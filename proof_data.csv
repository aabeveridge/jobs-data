                RESPONSIBILITIES:Kforce has a client seeking a Technical Writer II in Seattle, Washington (WA).Summary:This team is for a package of various software tools that helps game developers make games. Customer facing documentation by technical writers - customers are the people making games. Tickets are for documentation covering various topics. Game engines are very complex software used by designers, artists, programmers. Basically, a big tool with a bunch of smaller tools inside of it. Outstanding tickets are areas that haven't been documented. Ex: there is a spelling error on this page, or it can be larger, ex: particle editor needs to be documented. The team is trained and familiar so they take a day and half on average per ticket. Several hundred engineers writing software, documentation team was understaffed, can't keep up with new engineering work that was happening.Key projects: Clear backlog Chunks of tickets coalesce around a feature area, so the contractor will learn one without much randomization Get familiar with one area of the engine and work around areaWork environment: Pretty flexible, writers commute in from outside of Seattle Come in around 10-7 or 8 Early starters are fine too Other people on team will be there starting around 8:30-9Key Role: A period of collaboration with people who wrote the software, get trained on it and then it's head down while you're doing the writing; A little more collaboration while doing a technical review; Writing team is fairly introverted, talk one on one, not noisy and not a ton of conversations. No full-time remote, but once they get their feet under them, they can work from home one day per week; Need to be on site while they learn No headcount for full time, so conversion is probably not possible; Yes to extensions as long as contractor is hitting KPIs set up internally, getting good resultsREQUIREMENTS: A minimum of 5 years in a technical writing role Proven experience designing and delivering customer-oriented documentation Strong written and verbal communication skills Experience working directly with development teams Must have done documentation for a significant technical software product Ownership is pretty good indicator; Writers just document the stuff they've been told to document, but those who excel can also work in other documentation and see improvement spot, take initiative and make a change; If something has been presented in a certain way, and it's overly complicated to write about, maybe there's a better way to implement, so a good tech writer will let the engineers know Dive deep is important, have to dive into technical space and deeply understand before they write about it Automatic DQ: If they've never done documentation of a significantly technical software product, they need to see a history of that; Writers doing end user facing, IU that were fairly simple; This is technical software for developers who are technical people; If you see work where they've done developer facing documentationPreferred Skills: Experience with cloud services or game technology Experience with instructional design Experience with an XML-based authoring system Previous experience working in an agile environment Passion to thrive in a fast-paced, ever-changing environment Proven experience using and following the Microsoft Manual of Style for Technical Publications (MSTP) A proactive and open-minded attitude to resolving problems and delivering resultsKforce is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer.
