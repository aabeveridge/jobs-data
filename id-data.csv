"Senior Content Creator/Copywriter
We're a CPG specialist agency looking for a talented and proven writer fully capable of conceiving a big idea and equally deft at
expressing it through a social post, a TV spot or an online promotion. The 'hub' of your work for us will be in our Social Creative
Studio, working with a team consisting of Digital Strategists, Community Managers, and Visual Content Specialists. But we're a CPG
agency, not just a Social agency, so we expect our folks to be facile across channels. Your job is to move people and product with the
power of the written and spoken word wherever we can use it to competitive advantage.
This job requires a leader who is comfortable with being accountable for the development of inspiring ideas, and a clear track record
for delivering. We need a proactive and imaginative writer who wants the baton and will run with it, with considerable grace and skill.
We’re not looking for a talented writer to drink the social media Kool-Aid.We’re looking for that talented and EXPERIENCED writer
(minimum 5 years at an ad agency) who chugged it a long time ago, and is ready to do great work for a batch of some of the nation’s
best CPG brands.
Please be respectful of our time and the seriousness of our search for the right candidate and refrain from just ""throwing your hat in the
ring"" if your experience isn't a really good match with these requirements. However, if this sounds like a smart fit for us both, then
let’s start talking about the next great phase of your career.
Reports to: Creative Director - Copy
Responsibilities: Surprise! You should be a kickass writer with the portfolio to prove it. We expect to see examples of work that inspires
consumers to take action and think differently. But this is also about digital marketing IDEAS. Please share yours.
· Prove to us you can appeal to consumers' brains - but also to their hearts - with emotional, insightful copy that can't be
ignored and that stems from human truths. Tin Man’s good. Cowardly Lion’s even better.
Non-“people persons” need not apply. New media, and especially social, is where our client brands are most transparent and
honest with consumers, often acting as ""one of them.""
Get down with CPG. One look at our roster and you’ll figure out that CPG experience is more than just a plus for this position
– it’s what we need.
No fair only being social online. We need an experienced communicator who’s also the consummate team player – to meet
with social media managers and digital designers to discuss the client’s requirements, editorial calendars and core messaging.
If you’d rather send an email than get up and go to someone’s desk, you scare us (no, really).
We’re going to presume you do your homework. Our expectation is you’ll familiarize yourself with the products we sell, our
brands’ target audiences and competitors’ activities in the marketplace.
The ability to take the client’s brief and to write concise, attention-grabbing and hard-hitting copy is the “price of entry” here –
we want an original thinker, a brainstorming juggernaut, a seldom-satisfied, always-pushing-to-be better player ready to join
agency full of same.
We expect you to be presentable. Oh, and to present. First to your creative director (boss-like object) and then to share the
approved creative options to your clients (hey, they paid for them). We expect you to be a geek about the details, following assignment specs to a “t” while dotting the “i’s” and modifying your
copy and concepts until the client is beyond satisfied.
We expect you to be ultimately accountable for your own product and endlessly curious about creating the new best thing in
your book.
Qualifications / Requirements: Bachelor’s degree
A portfolio full of digital examples, including provocative, well-crafted copy
Minimum of 5 years copywriting experience, preferably in an ad agency working on CPG brands
A slavish devotion to social (Must live, eat, drink and breathe it!).
Interest in business, pop culture, and new advertising trends and techniques
Familiarity with digital best-practices and adopter of new technologies
Proactive, self-starter, self-manager, tenacious about finding solutions to problems
A commitment to pride in your work quality and the pursuit of self and work/career excellence

okay)

"OD International, Inc. is looking for a creative copywriter for a new skin care line that we are launching. We welcome a
bright copywriter with a sense of humor that understands female consumers and has extensive experience in skincare,
cosmetics or beauty categories. Strong recent social media writing experience is a must, specifically in the beauty
industry.

About Us:
While regular water makes the solution base of every cosmetic product in the market, OD International, Inc. bases all its products on a proprietary Micro Water Complex®. The inspiration to this technology is a phenomenon found in the waters of the Japanese volcanic hot springs, which for centuries have been known for their healing attributes for the skin, body and mind. The Active 'Micro-waters' are created through a natural process in which waters that spring up from volcanic activity carry with them a unique mineral charge, millions of years old, from the deep crusts of the earth. This charge changes the pH level and the molecular structure of the waters, rearranging them into molecule clusters that are twice as small as normal. These mineral-enhanced waters are famous for their superior absorbability that allows them to blend perfectly and effortlessly with skin at an intracellular level. Our labs authentically replicate this naturally occurring
phenomenon of Onsen active micro-waters by using state-of-the-art technology. These are no longer passive waters but
fast absorbing active molecules that deliver into the skin their mineral charge and any additional active ingredients that the
product contains for maximum effectiveness. This breakthrough means products that are up to 100% active!

The initial project looks like this:
• 10 articles of 1000 words each
• 1000 posts for social networks, including managing social media conversations
• 10 press releases
• 30 ads copy
• 10 landing pages copy
This may become an ongoing retainer based position.

What you will do:
- Develop immensely compelling copy and storytelling assets for all types of media - print, web, social and TV (infomercials).
- Help develop the voice and identity of the OD International, Inc. family of brands in marketing and advertising.
- Work with our agency partners, providing direction and ensuring super high quality for anything with our name on it.
- Participate in strategizing and developing opportunities for the Creative Marketing Team.

Here is your cheat sheet for the interview:
-You have a proven track record of great work across multiple 360 campaigns, online and offline, including strong
knowledge of social media.
-You have experience in the beauty industry! Show off your portfolio!
-You have a background of creating great copy and storytelling in marketing and building real emotional connections with the audience.
-You are a strong leader who values innovation and is looking to break exciting new ground.
-You have an entrepreneurial mindset and can work autonomously.
