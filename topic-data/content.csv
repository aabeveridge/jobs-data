"Senior Content Creator/Copywriter
We're a CPG specialist agency looking for a talented and proven writer fully capable of conceiving a big idea and equally deft at
expressing it through a social post, a TV spot or an online promotion. The 'hub' of your work for us will be in our Social Creative
Studio, working with a team consisting of Digital Strategists, Community Managers, and Visual Content Specialists. But we're a CPG
agency, not just a Social agency, so we expect our folks to be facile across channels. Your job is to move people and product with the
power of the written and spoken word wherever we can use it to competitive advantage.
This job requires a leader who is comfortable with being accountable for the development of inspiring ideas, and a clear track record
for delivering. We need a proactive and imaginative writer who wants the baton and will run with it, with considerable grace and skill.
We’re not looking for a talented writer to drink the social media Kool-Aid.We’re looking for that talented and EXPERIENCED writer
(minimum 5 years at an ad agency) who chugged it a long time ago, and is ready to do great work for a batch of some of the nation’s
best CPG brands.
Please be respectful of our time and the seriousness of our search for the right candidate and refrain from just ""throwing your hat in the
ring"" if your experience isn't a really good match with these requirements. However, if this sounds like a smart fit for us both, then
let’s start talking about the next great phase of your career.
Reports to: Creative Director - Copy
Responsibilities: Surprise! You should be a kickass writer with the portfolio to prove it. We expect to see examples of work that inspires
consumers to take action and think differently. But this is also about digital marketing IDEAS. Please share yours.
· Prove to us you can appeal to consumers' brains - but also to their hearts - with emotional, insightful copy that can't be
ignored and that stems from human truths. Tin Man’s good. Cowardly Lion’s even better.
Non-“people persons” need not apply. New media, and especially social, is where our client brands are most transparent and
honest with consumers, often acting as ""one of them.""
Get down with CPG. One look at our roster and you’ll figure out that CPG experience is more than just a plus for this position
– it’s what we need.
No fair only being social online. We need an experienced communicator who’s also the consummate team player – to meet
with social media managers and digital designers to discuss the client’s requirements, editorial calendars and core messaging.
If you’d rather send an email than get up and go to someone’s desk, you scare us (no, really).
We’re going to presume you do your homework. Our expectation is you’ll familiarize yourself with the products we sell, our
brands’ target audiences and competitors’ activities in the marketplace.
The ability to take the client’s brief and to write concise, attention-grabbing and hard-hitting copy is the “price of entry” here –
we want an original thinker, a brainstorming juggernaut, a seldom-satisfied, always-pushing-to-be better player ready to join
agency full of same.
We expect you to be presentable. Oh, and to present. First to your creative director (boss-like object) and then to share the
approved creative options to your clients (hey, they paid for them). We expect you to be a geek about the details, following assignment specs to a “t” while dotting the “i’s” and modifying your
copy and concepts until the client is beyond satisfied.
We expect you to be ultimately accountable for your own product and endlessly curious about creating the new best thing in
your book.
Qualifications / Requirements: Bachelor’s degree
A portfolio full of digital examples, including provocative, well-crafted copy
Minimum of 5 years copywriting experience, preferably in an ad agency working on CPG brands
A slavish devotion to social (Must live, eat, drink and breathe it!).
Interest in business, pop culture, and new advertising trends and techniques
Familiarity with digital best-practices and adopter of new technologies
Proactive, self-starter, self-manager, tenacious about finding solutions to problems
A commitment to pride in your work quality and the pursuit of self and work/career excellence
Social media case studies from campaigns you have worked on, stating your specific roles in the campaign (white-labels are
okay)
Ability to listen to the challenges of clients and coworkers and become part of the solution
Originality and an ability to think visually
Capable of bringing enthusiasm, curiosity and energy to the office every day
