bright copywriter with a sense of humor that understands female consumers and has extensive experience in skincare,
cosmetics or beauty categories. Strong recent social media writing experience is a must, specifically in the beauty
industry.

About Us:
While regular water makes the solution base of every cosmetic product in the market, OD International, Inc. bases all its products on a proprietary Micro Water Complex®. The inspiration to this technology is a phenomenon found in the waters of the Japanese volcanic hot springs, which for centuries have been known for their healing attributes for the skin, body and mind. The Active 'Micro-waters' are created through a natural process in which waters that spring up from volcanic activity carry with them a unique mineral charge, millions of years old, from the deep crusts of the earth. This charge changes the pH level and the molecular structure of the waters, rearranging them into molecule clusters that are twice as small as normal. These mineral-enhanced waters are famous for their superior absorbability that allows them to blend perfectly and effortlessly with skin at an intracellular level. Our labs authentically replicate this naturally occurring
phenomenon of Onsen active micro-waters by using state-of-the-art technology. These are no longer passive waters but
fast absorbing active molecules that deliver into the skin their mineral charge and any additional active ingredients that the
product contains for maximum effectiveness. This breakthrough means products that are up to 100% active!

The initial project looks like this:
• 10 articles of 1000 words each
• 1000 posts for social networks, including managing social media conversations
• 10 press releases
• 30 ads copy
• 10 landing pages copy
This may become an ongoing retainer based position.

What you will do:
- Develop immensely compelling copy and storytelling assets for all types of media - print, web, social and TV (infomercials).
- Help develop the voice and identity of the OD International, Inc. family of brands in marketing and advertising.
- Work with our agency partners, providing direction and ensuring super high quality for anything with our name on it.
- Participate in strategizing and developing opportunities for the Creative Marketing Team.

Here is your cheat sheet for the interview:
-You have a proven track record of great work across multiple 360 campaigns, online and offline, including strong
knowledge of social media.
